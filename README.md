# CSE201---Connect-4

Vision
Connect Four is a classic game where two players alternate placing colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row grid. The tokens will fall into the lowest available space in the column. In order to win, a player must be the first to have four (or more) of their colored pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. In our Java-coded version, the player will face-off against an AI that will accurately predict what moves the human player will attempt in the future.

Goals
-Functioning game board that allows player to add pieces to game board when a certain column is clicked
-Functioning AI that will look to hinder playersâ€™ ability to win, as well as trying to win itself
-Design that is simple enough that no instructions are needed while still looking professional
-Project phases are completed on time
